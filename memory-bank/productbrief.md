# üõ†Ô∏è PRD: Scouts Tribe Management Application

## üß≠ Overview

**Product Name:** ScoutsTribe  
**Target Users:** Scouts leaders, grade-level managers, counselors  
**Purpose:** Centralize communication, streamline documentation, and reduce organizational overhead for scouts group leaders and counselors.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

The current coordination and communication system for managing a scouts group is fragmented and inefficient:
- Critical messages are dispersed across multiple group chats, making them hard to find.
- Important spreadsheets are manually shared and maintained in different places.
- No unified platform exists to manage operations and streamline reporting.
- Organizational transitions between years are cumbersome, with no built-in mechanism to handle changes in group composition, leadership, or responsibilities.

---

## üåü Goals & Objectives

- Centralize communication, forms, and documents in a single platform.
- Enable easy and flexible assignment of roles and group compositions each year.
- Archive and separate prior year data while keeping it accessible for review.
- Provide a structured, searchable environment for operational continuity.
- Ensure messages and tasks reach the right users with minimal friction.
