# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - User Management & Messaging Enhancements

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Backend Setup:** Establishing the basic Express server, including dependencies (`express`, `nodemon`), scripts (`dev`), and initial file structure (`server.js`).
- **Authentication & Authorization Foundation:**
    - Implemented basic mock authentication logic (signup, login, logout) using an in-memory array.
    - Implemented mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) to protect routes based on mock user roles.
    - Added a sample protected route (`/api/admin/users`).
    - **Note:** Passwords stored as plain text for mock purposes only.
- **Core Features Implementation:**
    - Implemented mock data structures for messaging channels and messages.
    - Created API endpoints for listing channels, creating channels, listing messages, and posting messages.
    - Protected routes with the RBAC middleware based on appropriate roles.
    - Added CORS middleware to allow frontend API requests.
- **Frontend Implementation:**
    - Created API service layer with axios for communication with the backend.
    - Implemented authentication components (AuthContext, LoginForm, SignupForm).
    - Implemented messaging components (ChannelList, MessageList, MessagingDashboard).
    - Created pages for login, signup, messaging, and updated the home page.

## üìù Recent Changes

    - Edit and Delete buttons that appear on hover for the user's own messages
    - An inline edit form that appears when the Edit button is clicked
    - Visual indication when a message has been edited (shows "(edited)" next to timestamp)

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Known Issues:**
  - ~~Logout doesn't work well.~~ *Fixed by forcing page reload after logout.*
  - ~~Counselors get "channel not found" message when trying to post messages.~~ *Fixed by implementing proper channel access control.*
  - ~~Add User modal and Delete User Confirmation modal were incorrectly nested.~~ *Fixed by moving them outside the Change Roles modal.*
  - ~~Git push to remote repository failed.~~ *Resolved.*

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implemented a comprehensive RBAC system:
  - Admins can access and modify everything
  - Tribe Leaders can access all grades but can only create/modify content for their assigned grades
  - Counselors can only access and modify content for their assigned grade

- **Technology Choices:** Database choice deferred. Proceeding with mock data for authentication and messaging. Still using React/Next.js and Node.js/Express as planned.
