# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - Mock Auth & RBAC Implemented

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Backend Setup:** Establishing the basic Express server, including dependencies (`express`, `nodemon`), scripts (`dev`), and initial file structure (`server.js`).
- **Authentication & Authorization Foundation:**
    - Implemented basic mock authentication logic (signup, login, logout) using an in-memory array.
    - Implemented mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) to protect routes based on mock user roles.
    - Added a sample protected route (`/api/admin/users`).
    - **Note:** Passwords stored as plain text for mock purposes only.

## üìù Recent Changes

- Initialized core Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Created `.gitignore` file.
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created `client/` and `server/` directories.
- Initialized `package.json` in `server/` using `npm init -y`.
- Initialized Next.js project in `client/` using `npx create-next-app`.
- Attempted initial Git push (failed due to connection issue).
- Corrected client project location (moved from `server/client` to `client/`).
- Installed `express` and `nodemon` in `server/`.
- Added `dev` script to `server/package.json`.
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect server setup.
- Committed server setup changes to Git.
- Updated authentication routes (`/api/auth/...`) in `server/server.js` with mock logic using an in-memory user array.
- Added mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) and a sample protected route to `server/server.js`.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the implementation of mock RBAC.
2.  Commit documentation updates (`activeContext`, `progress`) and mock auth/RBAC implementation (`server.js`) to Git.
3.  Test the mock authentication and protected endpoints (e.g., using `curl` or a tool like Postman/Insomnia).
4.  Begin implementing core features based on MVP scope (e.g., messaging channels, forms), potentially starting with backend API routes using mock data.
5.  Revisit database decision when ready to move beyond mock data.
6.  Address the Git push connection issue when possible.

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Choices:** Database choice deferred. Proceeding with mock data for authentication. Still using React/Next.js and Node.js/Express as planned.
- **Directory Structure:** Deciding on the optimal monorepo or separate repo structure. Starting with a simple top-level `client` and `server` directory structure within this workspace.
