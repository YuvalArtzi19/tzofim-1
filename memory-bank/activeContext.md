# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - Frontend Components Implemented

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Backend Setup:** Establishing the basic Express server, including dependencies (`express`, `nodemon`), scripts (`dev`), and initial file structure (`server.js`).
- **Authentication & Authorization Foundation:**
    - Implemented basic mock authentication logic (signup, login, logout) using an in-memory array.
    - Implemented mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) to protect routes based on mock user roles.
    - Added a sample protected route (`/api/admin/users`).
    - **Note:** Passwords stored as plain text for mock purposes only.
- **Core Features Implementation:**
    - Implemented mock data structures for messaging channels and messages.
    - Created API endpoints for listing channels, creating channels, listing messages, and posting messages.
    - Protected routes with the RBAC middleware based on appropriate roles.
    - Added CORS middleware to allow frontend API requests.
- **Frontend Implementation:**
    - Created API service layer with axios for communication with the backend.
    - Implemented authentication components (AuthContext, LoginForm, SignupForm).
    - Implemented messaging components (ChannelList, MessageList, MessagingDashboard).
    - Created pages for login, signup, messaging, and updated the home page.

## üìù Recent Changes

- Initialized core Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Created `.gitignore` file.
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created `client/` and `server/` directories.
- Initialized `package.json` in `server/` using `npm init -y`.
- Initialized Next.js project in `client/` using `npx create-next-app`.
- Attempted initial Git push (failed due to connection issue).
- Corrected client project location (moved from `server/client` to `client/`).
- Installed `express` and `nodemon` in `server/`.
- Added `dev` script to `server/package.json`.
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect server setup.
- Committed server setup changes to Git.
- Updated authentication routes (`/api/auth/...`) in `server/server.js` with mock logic using an in-memory user array.
- Added mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) and a sample protected route to `server/server.js`.
- Added mock data structures for channels and messages in `server/server.js`.
- Implemented messaging channel API endpoints (`/api/channels`, `/api/channels/:channelId/messages`).
- Tested authentication, RBAC, and protected routes using `curl`.
- Installed axios in the client for API communication.
- Created folder structure for frontend components.
- Implemented authentication context and components.
- Implemented messaging components.
- Created pages for login, signup, and messaging.
- Updated the home page with navigation and information about ScoutsTribe.
- Installed CORS package and implemented CORS middleware in the server.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the frontend implementation.
2.  Commit documentation updates (`activeContext`, `progress`) and frontend implementation to Git.
3.  Test the frontend application by running the client and server together.
4.  *CORS handling implemented in the backend.*
5.  Fix issues with signup and login functionality in the frontend.
6.  Continue implementing additional core features from the MVP scope (e.g., forms, document upload).
7.  Revisit database decision when ready to move beyond mock data.
8.  Address the Git push connection issue when possible.

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Known Issues:** Signup and login functionality for newly signed-up users is not working correctly. This needs to be investigated and fixed in the next task.

- **Technology Choices:** Database choice deferred. Proceeding with mock data for authentication. Still using React/Next.js and Node.js/Express as planned.
- **Directory Structure:** Deciding on the optimal monorepo or separate repo structure. Starting with a simple top-level `client` and `server` directory structure within this workspace.
