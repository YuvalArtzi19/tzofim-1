# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - Project Initialization

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Project Setup:** Preparing the basic project structure (folders, initial configuration files) for a Node.js/Express backend and a React/Next.js frontend.
- **MVP Definition:** Clarifying the scope and features required for the Minimum Viable Product as outlined in the product brief.

## üìù Recent Changes

- Created initial versions of `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.
- This file (`activeContext.md`) was just created.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1.  Create the initial `progress.md` file.
2.  Set up the basic project directory structure (e.g., `client/` for frontend, `server/` for backend).
3.  Initialize `package.json` files for both client and server.
4.  Define the initial database schema (high-level) based on MVP features.
5.  Begin implementing the core features outlined in the MVP scope, starting with user roles and authentication.

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Choices:** Confirming the specific libraries/frameworks within the recommended stack (e.g., choosing between PostgreSQL and Firebase, deciding on specific React state management). For now, proceeding with the recommendations: React/Next.js, Node.js/Express. Database choice TBD, potentially starting with a simpler setup or mock data.
- **Directory Structure:** Deciding on the optimal monorepo or separate repo structure. Starting with a simple top-level `client` and `server` directory structure within this workspace.
