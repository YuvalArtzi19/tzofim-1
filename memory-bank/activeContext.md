# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - Project Initialization

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Project Setup:** Preparing the basic project structure (folders, initial configuration files) for a Node.js/Express backend and a React/Next.js frontend.
- **MVP Definition:** Clarifying the scope and features required for the Minimum Viable Product as outlined in the product brief.

## üìù Recent Changes

- Initialized core Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Created `.gitignore` file.
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created `client/` and `server/` directories.
- Initialized `package.json` in `server/` using `npm init -y`.
- Initialized Next.js project in `client/` using `npx create-next-app`.
- Attempted initial Git push (failed due to connection issue).
- Corrected client project location (moved from `server/client` to `client/`).

## üöÄ Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect project setup completion.
2.  Commit documentation updates to Git.
3.  Install necessary backend dependencies (e.g., Express) in `server/`.
4.  Create a basic Express server structure in `server/`.
5.  Define initial database schema (high-level) based on MVP features.
6.  Start implementing user roles and authentication (backend first).
7.  Address the Git push connection issue when possible.

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Choices:** Confirming the specific libraries/frameworks within the recommended stack (e.g., choosing between PostgreSQL and Firebase, deciding on specific React state management). For now, proceeding with the recommendations: React/Next.js, Node.js/Express. Database choice TBD, potentially starting with a simpler setup or mock data.
- **Directory Structure:** Deciding on the optimal monorepo or separate repo structure. Starting with a simple top-level `client` and `server` directory structure within this workspace.
