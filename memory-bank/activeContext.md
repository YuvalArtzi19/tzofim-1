# Active Context: ScoutsTribe - Messaging Channels API Implemented

## üéØ Current Focus

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Establishing the core documentation files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on the initial `productbrief.md`.
- **Backend Setup:** Establishing the basic Express server, including dependencies (`express`, `nodemon`), scripts (`dev`), and initial file structure (`server.js`).
- **Authentication & Authorization Foundation:**
    - Implemented basic mock authentication logic (signup, login, logout) using an in-memory array.
    - Implemented mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) to protect routes based on mock user roles.
    - Added a sample protected route (`/api/admin/users`).
    - **Note:** Passwords stored as plain text for mock purposes only.
- **Core Features Implementation:**
    - Implemented mock data structures for messaging channels and messages.
    - Created API endpoints for listing channels, creating channels, listing messages, and posting messages.
    - Protected routes with the RBAC middleware based on appropriate roles.

## üìù Recent Changes

- Initialized core Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Created `.gitignore` file.
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created `client/` and `server/` directories.
- Initialized `package.json` in `server/` using `npm init -y`.
- Initialized Next.js project in `client/` using `npx create-next-app`.
- Attempted initial Git push (failed due to connection issue).
- Corrected client project location (moved from `server/client` to `client/`).
- Installed `express` and `nodemon` in `server/`.
- Added `dev` script to `server/package.json`.
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect server setup.
- Committed server setup changes to Git.
- Updated authentication routes (`/api/auth/...`) in `server/server.js` with mock logic using an in-memory user array.
- Added mock RBAC middleware (`checkAuth`, `checkRole`) and a sample protected route to `server/server.js`.
- Added mock data structures for channels and messages in `server/server.js`.
- Implemented messaging channel API endpoints (`/api/channels`, `/api/channels/:channelId/messages`).
- Tested authentication, RBAC, and protected routes using `curl`.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1.  Update `progress.md` to reflect the implementation of messaging channels API.
2.  Commit documentation updates (`activeContext`, `progress`) and messaging channels implementation (`server.js`) to Git.
3.  Test the messaging channels API endpoints using `curl`.
4.  Continue implementing additional core features from the MVP scope (e.g., forms, document upload).
5.  Begin work on the frontend components to interact with the backend APIs.
6.  Revisit database decision when ready to move beyond mock data.
6.  Address the Git push connection issue when possible.

## ü§î Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Technology Choices:** Database choice deferred. Proceeding with mock data for authentication. Still using React/Next.js and Node.js/Express as planned.
- **Directory Structure:** Deciding on the optimal monorepo or separate repo structure. Starting with a simple top-level `client` and `server` directory structure within this workspace.
